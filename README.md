# Surfboard_Prediction_AI

# Project description:
In this project a Machine Learning programme was developed to predict which type of surfboard would suit the best for a specific person depending on different parameters such as the features of the person (surfing level, age, fitness, height, weight) and the size of waves.
The programme predicts 4 different characteristics of the surfboard that are the standard volume, real volume, length, and shape. Thus, the results obtained will be more precise than the current methods and it will give the user more detailed information of the board that they need. For all these features and targets, a dataset was created to feed the algorithm and, in order to make predictions, it was opted to use Machine Learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Multilayer Perceptron Regressor (MLP), and Random Forest Regressor (RF). Further, with the KNN algorithm, a graph is also represented to study how the accuracy changes depending on the number of neighbours that are taken to make the prediction.

# Programme function:
Simply run the python script and the programme will ask you to enter the data of the person and the waves. After you entered all the data, the programme will give you the result of the prediction that it was made, which indicates the charactersitics of the surfboard that best suits for the person.
